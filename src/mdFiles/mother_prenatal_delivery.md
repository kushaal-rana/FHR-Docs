# Brief summary

The "mother_peternal_delivery" table contains details about prenatal care, delivery events, and related data for pregnant mothers. It likely includes information about prenatal tests, delivery outcomes, and various metrics associated with the birthing process.

<!-- # Important considerations -->
<!-- 
* The data is sourced from the admission, discharge and transfer database from the hospital (often referred to as 'ADT' data).
* Organ donor accounts are sometimes created for patients who died in the hospital. These are distinct hospital admissions with very short, sometimes negative lengths of stay. Furthermore, their `DEATHTIME` is frequently the same as the earlier patient admission's `DEATHTIME`.
* All text data, except for that in the `INSURANCE` column, is stored in upper case. -->
