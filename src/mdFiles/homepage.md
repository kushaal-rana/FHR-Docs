<p>
  <!-- Welcome to the documentation for the FHR (Fetal Heart Rate) database. <br></br>This resource provides detailed information about the FHR database, its structure, and how to use it effectively. Whether you're a healthcare professional, researcher, or just curious about fetal monitoring data, this documentation will guide you through the essential aspects of the database. -->

  We developed the the SBU-FHR database of cardiotocography (CTG), comprising fetal heart rate (FHR), maternal heart rate (MHR), and uterine contraction (TOCO) recordings during childbirth, along with vital signs, diagnostic codes, co-morbidities, labs for both the mothers and the children, for all deliveries between January 1, 2018 and December 31,2021, at Stony Brook University Hospital and affiliated hospitals (i.e., a total of 10,323 deliveries).
  <br></br>
  The database is anonymized for public consumption by removing all identifying information and modifying the birth dates and times of the mothers (and all other relative dates and times) with randomized dates and times ranging between 300 and 400 years. This ensures that all information relative to deliveries (such as, mother age, diagnoses and labs) are accurately recorded, but it removes identifying information. This present study received approval from the Institutional Review Board of Stony Brook University Hospital.
  <br></br>
  The database is accompanied by an intuitive web-based tool for querying to support physicians and researchers of maternal health, fetal well-being, and obstetric care, who may not have the skills to write complex SQL queries, to find aggregate information from the database. The tool includes creating logical conditions over the data, automatically joins tables and creates a correct SQL query, provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to explore individual records and visualize FHR signals, and the ability to export data.
